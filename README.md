# Book Search

A personal project. It acts somewhat like a search engine. The user types in an author, genre, topic, or audience, and it will recommend a saved book series based on the inputted "tags." It's currently a MVP.

## Purpose

I enjoy reading books, and I wanted to make a small program that acted like how a search engine would function if I wanted to find more books to read.

## Tech

A Java project.

## Getting Started

Java must be installed on your device.

To run the project, you must compile all the Java files, and then you run the driver class.
